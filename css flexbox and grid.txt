                 flexbox

when contents going  from top to bottom use css flexbox




                 grid 
when  content going in two direction like it had some stuff from top to bottom and left to right  use css grid




//now text align only works on inline element now since image is an inline it's is centred but we created div for our content so our content is not in centred.To centred it---  you can do  margin:auto or flexbox


                 			

text align 						flex	

						display:flex;	
text-align:center				align-items:center;
margin:auto;					text-align:center;
display:block					flex-direction: column;


if there is something which is not there in desktop we should take in ccount of that in media queries for eg:-paading left and right on mobile but is not there in desktop

for desktop:- padding-left:0;
padding-right:0;
